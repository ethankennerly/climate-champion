# Carbon budget

- 770 GtCO2 for 1.5 C
- 1690 GtCO2 for 2 C
- 7.7 billion people.
- 100 tCO2/person for 1.5 C.
- 200 tCO2/person for 2 C.
- 40 GtCO2e/year for 3 C.
- 5 tCO2e/person/year for 3 C.

CO2e Per capita in 2013:
- India 1.5 tons
- China 6.7 tons
- US 17 tons
- <https://www.energy.gov/articles/interactive-how-much-carbon-do-countries-emit>

- US minimum 8.5 tons/year/capita.
<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080428120658.htm>

- I estimate US government average 3 tCO2e/year/capita if budget CO2 efficiency is half that of a citizen consumer purchasing goods.
- By the same estimation formula, I estimated India's tCO2e/year/capita being about 5 times more efficient than US. That is about 0.6 tCO2e.

- 0.4 tCO2e/year/capita from Federal Government.
- 2011 federal government 121.3 MtCO2e/year. 54.9 military.
<https://carbonfund.org/2011/05/02/federal-government-reports-hefty-carbon-footprint/>
- US population 312 M in 2011.
<https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&met_y=population&hl=en&dl=en>

- 0.3 - 3 tCO2e/year/capita from municipal government.
